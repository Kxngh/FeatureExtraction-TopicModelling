jeff106.pdf,"If you do, you perhaps know that a pet is a serious responsibility."
jeff106.pdf,Read in the box below what the SPCA — the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals — has to say about how to care for a pet.
jeff106.pdf,Owning a pet is a lifetime of commitment (up to ten years or more if you own a dog or a cat) involving considerable responsibility.
jeff106.pdf,"The decision to acquire one, therefore, should be made by the whole family."
jeff106.pdf,"Without full agreement by everyone, the pet could end up unwanted."
jeff106.pdf,"Puppies and kittens are so adorable, it is easy to understand why adults and children alike would be attracted to them."
jeff106.pdf,"Unfortunately their cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people purchase them without consideration and the knowledge on how to take proper care of them."
jeff106.pdf,"The basic points you should keep in mind before adopting a puppy are: •an annual dog licence in accordance with government regulations •its annual vaccination against major diseases •toilet training •regular grooming and bathing •obedience training •don’t forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet •socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied up to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing on shoes — this is wrong) is very important •a daily dose of exercise, affection and play."

jeff106.pdf,"For the first twenty- four hours Mijbil was neither hostile nor friendly; he was simply aloof and indifferent, choosing to sleep on the floor as far from my bed as possible."
jeff106.pdf,"The second night Mijbil came on to my bed in the small hours and remained asleep in the crook of my knees until the servant brought tea in the morning, and during the day he began to lose his apathy and take a keen, much too keen, interest in his surroundings."
jeff106.pdf,"I made a body-belt for him and took him on a lead to the bathroom, where for half an hour he went wild with joy in the water , plunging and rolling in it, shooting up and down the length of the bathtub underwater , and making enough slosh and splash for a hippo."
jeff106.pdf,"This, I was to learn, is a characteristic of otters; every drop of water must be, so to speak, extended and spread about the place; a bowl must at once be overtur ned, or , if it will not be overturned, be sat in and sploshed in until it over flows."
